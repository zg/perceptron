perceptron
==========
This program simulates a perceptron.  It takes in a threshold, learning rate (alpha), the initial weights, and an operation.  The program will output a chart that follows through each epoch and arrive at finalized weights.  This program contains no error checking, so, for example, running this program against the XOR operation will result in an infinite loop.
